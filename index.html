      <h1>how to play</h1>
      <p>Its bingo! Get 5 in a row and you win. However, there are be additional rules you might want to play with such as:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You can't mark a square until it acually happens in the episode (good for playing with people who have watched the show a bunch of times and know every episode by heart lol)</li>
        <li>If there is no bingo by the end of the episode, the person with the most squares marked wins</li>
        <li>You can close and open the app the reset your bingo sheet if you feel the squares you have don't apply well to the episode. However, you cannot do this if you've already marked a square or have reached ten minutes into the episode</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can find every possible bingo square on the <a href="./list.html">list</a> page. Check out the support section to find out how you can submit items to be added to the list!</p>
